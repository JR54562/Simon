# Simon
-Description-
Simon is a simple game of following the presented patterns. 

![Alt text](/Simon_ss.png?raw=true "Simon Game Screenshot")


-Brief example-

When Simon launches, it shows a board with 4 colors showing. 

- Player clicks Start button, a pattern of 1 is shown to user. 

- Player will then need to click the same button sequence to get past the round successfully.

- The next round will add another color to the sequence.

Getting Started -

- Press Start button to begin a new round.
- Click the corresponding "flashed" panel to proceed.
- If you fail, press Restart to try another time. 

Approach:

- I built an HTML page with a table of 4 cells
- Styling to make the cells visible.
- Game shows you a pattern by changing the background color of a cell.
```
// for each index in compArray, flash the same index in 'sequence'
// - change backgroundColor to "white" for 1 sec timer
// change back to default value
flash();
function flash() {
  for (let i = 0; i < compArray.length; i++) {
    setTimeout(function () {
      sequence[compArray[i]].style.backgroundColor = "white";
    }, 1000 * (i + 1));
    setTimeout(function () {
      sequence[compArray[i]].style.backgroundColor = colors[compArray[i]];
    }, 1100 * (i + 1));
  }
}
```
- Once the array has been shown to the user, player gets to make choice of panels in the correct order. 
```
// each panel that gets selected is added to the player array.
function panelClick(e) {
  let y = e.target.attributes.name.value;
  userArray.push(parseInt(y));
  if (userArray.length === compArray.length) {
    checker();
  }
}
```

- Game then tells you if you pass or fail. Continue or restart. 
```
// The checker function looks to compare the two arrays for length first and then values.
// If they don't match, the game ends and a restart is available.
function checker() {
  for (i = 0; i < compArray.length; i++) {
    if (userArray[i] != compArray[i]) {
      z = 1;
      alert("You have failed this round. Try again?");
      userArray = [];
      compArray = [];
      level = 1;
      resetGame.innerText = "Restart?";
    }
  }
  if (z === 0) {
    userArray = [];
    rndChange();
    // run the round changer
  }
}
```
- Start/Restart button. All rounds are started with the following code:
```
// ~Change rounds~
// This is the gameplay mechanics. Calls for the new sequence to be shown.
function rndChange() {
  round.innerText = "Round " + level;
  level++; //increase the level
  addCompColor(); // ~This adds new color added to compArray~
  flash(); // call function to show sequence compiled  to player
}
```
